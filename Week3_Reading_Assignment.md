# Reactions to Geoff Boeing Readings
The connection between the desing of roadways and sprawl is something that's regularly brought up in what I've encountered so far in the Planning space, but I had never thought of connecting the grid system of streets seen in so many cities across the country to this phenomenon. For me, grids have long been an indication of urban life. The grid signals to me order, efficiency, and connection. However, some of the earliest origins of grid layouts for cities do not have their roots in such innocent intentions. The Spanish Law of the Indies for example was in part a way for colonial powers to exercise surveillance in urban areas and   to create clear demarcations for the purposes of segregating native populations. I find it interesting and, to a certain extent, ironic that the revival of the grid system is now being argued for.  With the grid system becoming obsolete due to the widespread adoption of automobiles, a new form of spatial injustice is currently taking place.
One of the most interesting findings in the paper was the observation that states w/ higher grid index values are largely rural states in the Midwest that would be least likely to have a large demand for public transit and more likely to have widespread automobile adoption given how far spread everything is
