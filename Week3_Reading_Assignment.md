# Reactions to Geoff Boeing Readings
The connection between the desing of roadways and sprawl is one I've regularly encountered, but I had never thought of connecting the grid layout of streets seen in so many cities across the country to this phenomenon. For me, grids have long been an indication of urban life. The grid signals to me order, efficiency, and cohesiveness. However, some of the earliest origins of grid layouts for cities do not have their roots in such innocent intentions. The Spanish Law of the Indies for example was in part a way for colonial powers to exercise surveillance in urban areas and to create clear demarcations for the purposes of segregating native populations. I find it interesting and, to a certain extent, ironic that the revival of the grid system is now being argued for.  With the grid system becoming obsolete due to the widespread adoption of automobiles, a new form of spatial injustice is currently taking place.

Boeing's methods of examining street networks of Census tracts using OpenStreeMap data downloaded via OSMnx is particularly fascinating to me, as I see this as an application and use of data that I could model my own research off of. Instead of taking a look at street networks using OpenStreetMap, I plan to look at parks and other green spaces. In using these methods, Boeing's most interesting finding in the paper was the observation that states with higher grid index values are largely rural states in the Midwest. This seems to conflict with my intuition that these states would be less likely to have a large demand for public transit and more likely to have widespread automobile adoption given the lower density of such regions. 

# Questions for Geoff Boeing
1. You give the example of Syracuse in your paper as one municipality that is reverting back to the grid system. Are there other cities in the US or elsewhere that  are pursuing similar changes? Is there one city in particular that you think has the grid system down really well? Or where it's really evident that the grid system has resulted in a better quality of life for city residents?

2. How do you see data science and big data methods informing the design of cities going forward? Will data science skills eventually become a prerequisite for planners?
