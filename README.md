## Profile
First-year MURP student from Philly, but have lived in Washington, DC, Singapore, and Egypt. Currently concentrating in design and development, but hoping to create my own concentration that meshes urban data science and design in one...still figuring out what that'll look like!
## UP206A Course Description
Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Data Science walks students through the process of acquiring, managing, manipulating, modeling, and communicating urba data. The course focuses on how students can apply data skills to their own research endeavors and hopes to familiarize students with spatial data and techniques. Students will learn skills in Python for the purposes of urban planning and analysis. 
## Project Ideas
If I time allowed for it, I would delve into one of the many urban issues I've taken interest in over the years. A few that are of particular interest that would be great to explore for the purposes of this class include: 
  * Impact of rising sea levels on informal settlements
  * Mapping the relationship between urban green space and air quality in Los Angeles 
  * Mapping of food deserts in and around indigenous land/spaces
## Objectives for the Class
My biggest goal for this class is to gain the necessary skills needed to effectively work and communicate data using Python. I would also love to explore Python libraries that can generate maps like Follium because maps are dope !
