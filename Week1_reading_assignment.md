This article, from the online publication Runner's World, speaks not only to the deep history and reality of segregation in Baltimore, but how this *spatially* feeds into the practice of running. After a description of some of the most popular running routes in the city, Reddinger begins to illustrate the racialization of running that exists within Baltimore city lines. Areas that are dominated by low-income, African American communities lack many of the features that would attract runners: tidy parks, paved sidewalks, scenic views. Interestingly enough, this observation has been quanitified and visuzlied using the popular digital exercise application, Strava. Derived using Strava's built-in GPS capabilities, the heatmap below highlights the correlation between Baltimore's most frequented running routes and racial segregation. The white L that becomes apparent in the above map not only consists of Baltimore's most popular running routes, but also happens to be home to all of Baltimore's running shops and Baltimore's predominantly white neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the areas hidden darkness, resembling the wings of a black butterfly, are predominantly black neighborhoods that see very little running traffic. The image shows how the power of spatial data can make a stark difference in how inequality, within even the most mundane of things (like running), is perceived.
