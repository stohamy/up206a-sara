# UCLA/USC Humanitarian Mapathon Reflection
This was my first mapathon ever and it was an overwhelmingly positive experience! I started off day one by attending one of the tutorial sessions on how to digitize buildings. I think the term "mapathon" can be a bit intimidating. For me, the first thing that comes to mind is some intense spatial analysis using GIS or ESRI products. So to say I was surprised to learn that mapping can literally be done by anyone using OSM was super cool! On day one, I digitized around 130 buildings in Indonesia.   

On day 2 I focused on attending as many workshops as I could. I began with the Tableau workshop, which I personally found to be the most helpful. Prior to starting the MURP program, I worked at an affordable housing nonprofit with a pretty robust data and analysis department. I was always really fascinated by the work that the data and analysis team did and they constantly used Tableau to create public-facing interactive visualizations. Ever since getting that kind of exposure I've been wanting to have more hands on learning experiences with Tableau. I could already tell that Tableau would be a great way to create visualizations related to my own project for this course, but of course that'll be something I explore on my own time, as I don't think that Tableau is in the scope of this course. Joy and Zoey did a great job as instructors, and I can't wait to explore using Tableau in my free time. 

I also attended the first half of the R and GIS workshop with Andy. Although I couldn't attend the full workshop, the capability of R seems really similar to that of Python. However, I much prefer the coding environment we're using in this course than that of R studio. I also think that Python code is far more intuitive in its commands and language than R. Nonetheless, it was still neat getting to explore TinyCensus capabilities in R. 

Finally, and perhaps my favorite part, was listening to Ben Welsh's keynote speech on Friday. Getting to learn more about the LA Times Graphics and Data Team was a great inside look at the application of all that we've learned in this class and during the mapathon. Data journalism seems like a fascinating field and it was great to hear from a practitioner. 

Overall, the mapathon was a great experience, and I've already made sure to register for the UC GIS Week coming up in just a few weeks!
