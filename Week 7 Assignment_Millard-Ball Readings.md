# Reaction to Adam Millard-Ball Piece "Global Trends Toward Urban Street-Network Sprawl"
Professor Millard-Ball's piece on street-network sprawl reminded me a lot of Geoff Boeing's piece on street-network grids in the US. I appreciated Millard-Ball's global perspective on the topic, which I think motivated a lot of the inquiries I had while reading this piece. The conclusions drawn about Southeast Asia and Latin America being among the top two regions with accelerating rates of street-network sprawl was not entirely surprising to me. Both regions are among the fastest to urbanize and consist of many emerging market economies. To me the idea of street-network sprawl co-varies with economic growth. The idea of suburbanization is one highly associated with a rising middle-class, and so it isn't surprising for me to see Professor Millard-Ball's piece note that Southeast Asian and Latin American cities have increasing SNDi scores. I think what was more surprising was the observation that the US was working in a corrective direction, and reinstate street connectedness that was lost over time. I'm curious to see where exactly in the US this is happening. It would be hard to believe that such activity was underway in a city like LA. But perhaps I'm wrong. 

# Questions for Professor Millard-Ball
* How do certain topographical features impact a country's likelihood to experience street-network sprawl?
* I'm curious as to the ways in which colonial legacies have impacted the existence of street-network sprawl today. Law of the Indies in Latin America, for example, you acknowledged as having a considerable influence on the region's low SNDi score. What about other regions? What influence has colonial planning practices had on  street connectivity worldwide? (i.e. French in  North Africa and British and Dutch in SEA)
* What do global trends say about "New Cities"? I'm thinking like the New Towns of Cairo, Egypt or even the proposed new capital of Indonesia. What, if any, emphasis is being placed on laying out new cities and towns on a grid system?
* I wonder if regions or countries with primate cities (one large city that dominates the urban ecosystem) have higher or lower SNDi scores than countries/regions that have several competing cities.
